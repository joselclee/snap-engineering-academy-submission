                This website was made purely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from the starter code provided by
                Snapchat Engineering Academy. 
                <br>
                This is the project submitted by Jose Leandre Castillo Lee for the 2024 cohort. 
                <br><br>
                The website is a catalog of my favorite cars. The cars are displayed in cards that can be 
                clicked to reveal more information about the car. The website is responsive and can be viewed on any device.
                The cards can also be removed by clicking the "-" button on the top right corner of the card. Once the card is removed,
                the site adds a new card from the catalog of cars until there is none left.
                <br><br>

                Under the cars tab, you are able to see all the cars in the catalog as well as add a car you think should be in the catalog!
